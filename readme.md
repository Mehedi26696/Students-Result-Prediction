## Introduction
The Students Performance Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict students' academic performance. By understanding the key factors that affect performance, educators and policymakers can make informed decisions to enhance the learning experience.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `student-data.csv`, which contains various features related to students' demographics, academic records, and other relevant information.  
These features are used to train and evaluate the machine learning models to predict students' performance.
## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/students-performance-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd students-performance-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app for this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Streamlit installed. If not, install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
